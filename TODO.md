# TODO - Known Issues and Future Work

## üöß In Progress / Known Issues

### Custom Mesh Tab (Tab #6)
**Status:** Partially Functional - Needs Testing & Bug Fixes

**Known Issues:**
- [ ] STL file loading still has issues with some files
- [ ] Face normals computation may not work for all STL formats
- [ ] Need better error messages when mesh loading fails
- [ ] Camera positioning sometimes shows empty scene
- [ ] Scale defaults may not work well for all mesh sizes

**To Fix:**
- Add mesh bounding box detection for automatic camera positioning
- Implement mesh validation before rendering
- Add preview/wireframe mode
- Better default scale based on mesh dimensions
- Support for more file formats (FBX, COLLADA, glTF)
- Add mesh statistics display (vertices, faces, etc.)

**Test Cases Needed:**
- [ ] Test with various OBJ files
- [ ] Test with various PLY files (ASCII and binary)
- [ ] Test with various STL files (ASCII and binary)
- [ ] Test with very large meshes (100k+ vertices)
- [ ] Test with very small meshes
- [ ] Test with multi-material meshes

### Inverse Rendering Tab (Tab #7)
**Status:** Informational Only - Interactive Features Not Implemented

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Variant checker works
- ‚úÖ Documentation links provided
- ‚úÖ Example runner instructions
- ‚ùå No interactive rendering
- ‚ùå No optimization visualization
- ‚ùå No parameter recovery interface

**Missing Features:**
- [ ] Interactive image upload for target
- [ ] Real-time optimization progress display
- [ ] Loss curve plotting
- [ ] Parameter sliders for optimization targets
- [ ] Preview during optimization iterations
- [ ] Export recovered parameters to file
- [ ] Multi-image reconstruction interface
- [ ] NeRF-style GUI integration

**Dependencies:**
- Requires AD variant (llvm_ad_rgb or cuda_ad_rgb)
- Needs matplotlib for plotting
- May need additional optimization libraries

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create optimization worker thread (similar to render worker)
2. Add image upload widget
3. Implement loss visualization
4. Add optimization parameter controls
5. Create results export functionality
