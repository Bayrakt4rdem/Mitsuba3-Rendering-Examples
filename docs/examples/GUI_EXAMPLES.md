**Caustics Explained:**
When light passes through curved transparent objects, it focuses into patterns called caustics. Think of:

- Pool bottom ripples on sunny days
- Rainbow patterns from crystal

**Rendering Tips:**
- **SPP:** Use 512+ for clean caustics
- **Max Depth:** Use 12+ for multiple glass bounces
- **Background:** White shows caustics best
- **Light:** Point lights create sharper caustics than area lights

### 5. Cornell Box (`cornell_box.py`)

- Indirect lighting
- Light bounces
- Energy conservation

**What You'll Learn:**
- How light bounces between surfaces
- Color bleeding (red wall ‚Üí white floor)
- Difference between direct and indirect lighting
- Why global illumination looks realistic
- Cornell Box as rendering benchmark

**What is Cornell Box?**
The Cornell Box is a classic computer graphics test scene created at Cornell University in 1984. It's used to:
- Test global illumination algorithms
- Compare rendering accuracy
- Validate physically-based rendering
- Demonstrate color bleeding

**Scene Components:**
- **Left Wall:** Red (reflects red light onto objects)
- **Right Wall:** Green (reflects green light onto objects)
- **Back/Floor/Ceiling:** White (neutral, shows color bleeding)
- **Area Light:** Overhead (soft shadows, indirect lighting)
- **Objects:** Metallic sphere + diffuse cube

**Color Bleeding Effect:**
Notice how:
- Left side of white objects appears reddish (from red wall)
- Right side appears greenish (from green wall)
- This is indirect lighting (global illumination)
- Light bounces off colored walls onto objects

**Parameters:**
- Box dimensions
- Light intensity and size
- Wall colors (left/right RGB)
- Object sizes (sphere and cube)
- Render quality (SPP)

## üî¨ Scientific Concepts

### Index of Refraction (IOR)
**Physics:** When light moves between materials with different densities, it bends. The amount of bending depends on the IOR ratio.

**Snell's Law:** n‚ÇÅ √ó sin(Œ∏‚ÇÅ) = n‚ÇÇ √ó sin(Œ∏‚ÇÇ)
- n‚ÇÅ, n‚ÇÇ = IOR of materials
- Œ∏‚ÇÅ, Œ∏‚ÇÇ = angles of incidence and refraction

**Practical:** 
- Higher IOR = more bending
- IOR difference creates refraction
- Same IOR = no bending (invisible)

### Fresnel Effect
At grazing angles, materials become more reflective:
- Look at water straight down: see through
- Look at water at shallow angle: see reflection
- This happens with all materials!

### Global Illumination
Light doesn't just travel from light ‚Üí object ‚Üí camera. It bounces:
1. Light ‚Üí red wall ‚Üí bounces red light
2. Red light ‚Üí white floor ‚Üí floor looks reddish
3. Multiple bounces create realistic lighting
4. Path tracer simulates this

### Caustics
Focused light from curved transparent/reflective surfaces:
- Convex (bulging) surfaces focus light
- Concave (hollow) surfaces scatter light
- Creates concentrated bright patterns
- Requires high SPP to render cleanly

## üí° Rendering Tips

### For Fast Previews
- SPP: 64-128
- Resolution: 400√ó300 or smaller
- Simple scenes (Basic, Materials)

### For Quality Renders
- SPP: 512-1024
- Resolution: 800√ó600 or larger
- Complex scenes (Glass, Cornell Box)

### For Production Quality
- SPP: 2048+
- Resolution: 1920√ó1080+
- All scenes
- Be patient! Can take 10+ minutes

### SPP Guide
- **64:** Fast preview, very noisy
- **128:** Quick preview, noisy
- **256:** Good quality, acceptable noise
- **512:** High quality, minimal noise
- **1024:** Excellent quality, very clean
- **2048+:** Production quality, nearly perfect

### When to Use High SPP
- Glass scenes (caustics are noisy)
- Cornell Box (global illumination is noisy)
- Final renders
- Detailed inspection

## üéØ Common Issues

### Issue: Black/Dark Images
**Cause:** Light intensity too low
**Fix:** Increase light intensity parameter

### Issue: Overexposed/White Images
**Cause:** Light intensity too high
**Fix:** Decrease light intensity parameter

### Issue: Noisy/Grainy Results
**Cause:** Not enough samples (SPP too low)
**Fix:** Increase SPP in Home tab (512+)

### Issue: Glass Looks Weird
**Cause:** Not enough bounces or SPP
**Fix:** 
- Increase SPP to 512+
- Check that max_depth is 12+ (automatic in our scenes)

### Issue: No Caustics Visible
**Cause:** Background too dark or SPP too low
**Fix:**
- Use white background
- Increase SPP to 512+
- Increase light intensity

### Issue: Render Takes Forever
**Cause:** Too high SPP or resolution
**Fix:**
- Lower SPP for preview (128)
- Reduce resolution (400√ó300)
- Use simpler scenes first
