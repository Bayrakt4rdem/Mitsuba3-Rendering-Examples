   ```
   âœ“ Should see a red sphere rendered

2. **Run Basic Scene**
   ```powershell
   python 01_basic_scene.py
   ```
   âœ“ Understand: scene dict, integrator, sensor, shapes, materials, lights

3. **Experiment**
   - Change sphere color to blue: `[0.1, 0.1, 0.8]`
   - Move camera: change `origin` in look_at()
   - Adjust FOV: try `fov=30` or `fov=70`
   - Change light position

### Key Concepts

## Phase 2: Materials (Days 2-3)

### Goals
- Understand different material types
- Learn when to use each BSDF

### Steps
1. **Materials Showcase**
   ```powershell
   python 02_materials_showcase.py
   ```
   âœ“ See 5 different material types side-by-side

2. **Study Each Material**
   - **Diffuse**: Matte surfaces (walls, paper, cloth)
   - **Conductor**: Metals (gold, copper, aluminum)
   - **RoughConductor**: Brushed metals
   - **Dielectric**: Transparent (glass, water, diamond)
   - **Plastic**: Glossy coating over matte base

3. **Experiments**
   - Create a scene with only metal objects
   - Try different roughness values: 0.0 (mirror) to 1.0 (very rough)
   - Make a glass of water (dielectric sphere)
   - Combine materials in one scene

### Key Concepts
- BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function)

- Learn professional lighting setups

### Steps
1. **Lighting Techniques**
   ```powershell
   python 03_lighting_techniques.py
   ```
   âœ“ Compare 6 different lighting setups

2. **Study Lighting Types**
   - **Point Light**: Fast, hard shadows (light bulb)
   - **Area Light**: Realistic, soft shadows (softbox)
   - **Directional**: Parallel rays (sun)
   - **Environment**: Sky dome (outdoor lighting)

3. **Professional Setups**
   - Three-point lighting (key + fill + back)
   - Color temperature (warm vs cool)
   - Light intensity and falloff
   - Multiple light interactions

4. **Experiments**
   - Create dramatic lighting (single side light)
   - Make sunset lighting (warm directional + orange tint)
   - Studio portrait lighting (three-point setup)
   - Moody scene (low-key lighting)

### Key Concepts
- Direct vs indirect lighting
- Shadow quality (hard/soft)
- Light intensity and units
- Color temperature
- Three-point lighting technique

## Phase 4: Global Illumination (Day 6)

### Goals
- Understand light transport

- Learn about indirect lighting

### Steps
1. **Cornell Box**
   ```powershell
   python 05_cornell_box.py
   ```
   âœ“ The classic global illumination demo

2. **Observe Carefully**
   - Red tint on left side of boxes (from red wall)
   - Green tint on right side (from green wall)
   - Soft shadows under boxes
   - Bright ceiling near light
   - Ambient light in shadowed areas

3. **Experiments**
   - Set `max_depth=1`: See direct lighting only (no color bleeding!)
   - Set `max_depth=2`: One bounce (some color)
   - Set `max_depth=8`: Full global illumination
   - Change wall colors to blue and yellow
   - Add a glass sphere (see caustics!)

### Key Concepts
- Global illumination vs local illumination
- Light bouncing
- Color bleeding
- Indirect lighting
- Ray depth and convergence

## Phase 5: Advanced Scenes (Days 7-10)

### Goals
- Combine all techniques
- Build complex scenes
- Optimize render quality

### Steps
1. **Advanced Scene**
   ```powershell
   python 04_advanced_scene.py
   ```
   âœ“ Multiple materials + complex lighting

2. **Analyze the Scene**
   - How are objects positioned?
   - Why does the lighting work?
   - What makes it look professional?
   - How do materials interact?

3. **Create Your Own Scene**
   Start simple, add complexity:
   - Plan: Sketch your scene on paper
   - Build: Start with basic shapes
   - Light: Add one light at a time
   - Refine: Adjust materials and positions
   - Polish: Increase quality settings

### Example Project Ideas
- **Still Life**: Fruits on a table
- **Product Visualization**: Phone, watch, or gadget
- **Jewelry**: Gems with glass and metal
- **Architectural**: Room interior
- **Abstract**: Geometric composition

## Phase 6: Optimization & Quality (Days 11-14)

### Goals
- Balance quality vs speed
- Understand render settings
- Debug common issues

### Key Settings to Master

#### Samples Per Pixel (spp)
- **16-32**: Fast preview (noisy)
- **64-128**: Good quality
- **256-512**: High quality
- **1024+**: Production quality

#### Max Depth (light bounces)
- **2-4**: Fast, direct lighting
- **6-8**: Standard quality
- **12-16**: Complex materials (glass, metals)
- **32+**: Very complex scenes (usually not needed)

#### Resolution
- **256x256**: Quick tests
- **512x512**: Standard preview
- **1024x768**: Good quality
- **1920x1080**: HD output
- **4K+**: Final production

### Optimization Tips
1. **Preview First**: Use low spp/resolution for composition
2. **Progressive**: Start with max_depth=4, increase if needed
3. **Target Problem Areas**: Only high quality where visible
4. **Use Denoising**: For faster high-quality results
5. **Profile**: Identify slow parts of scene
